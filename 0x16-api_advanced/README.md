# API Advanced | 0x16

## Overview
This project helped me understand working with web APIs, the Reddit API.

## Tasks:

### 0. How many subs?
  Wrote a function `number_of_subscribers` that:
  - Accepts `subreddit` as its parameter
  - Queries the Reddit API to fetch the total number of subscribers for the given subreddit
  - Returns the total number of subscribers
  - Returns `0` if the subreddit is invalid
