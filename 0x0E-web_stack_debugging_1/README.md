# 0X0E | Web stack debugging #1

## Overview
The second in the Web stack debugging series. In this project I was tasked with writing a script that ensures Nginx server runs and listens on the specified port `80`.
### **Steps Taken**
- Verified that Nginx is installed.
- Ensured that Nginx is running (if installed).
- Ensured Nginx was listening on the specified port (80)
- Ensured no other process was using the specified port (80)
- Restarted Nginx to apply all changes

## Tasks:
- 0. Nginx likes port 80
